<span id="about"></span>
### About

The Open Bank Project API is a RESTful API for banks that supports multiple views on transaction data, data enrichment and data blurring.

The protocol consists of *baseline* and *optional* end points.
For baseline compliance, all the baseline URLs must be implemented.
For full compliance, all the baseline and optional end points must be implemented.

 * All calls should be prefixed with /obp/v1.1

 * The OBP API returns JSON as specified [here](http://www.json.org/) and validated [here](http://jsonlint.com/). 

 * Parameters within the URL are written in CAPITAL_LETTERS.

 * Some calls require OAuth headers ([See here for more details](https://github.com/OpenBankProject/OBP-API/wiki/OAuth-1.0-Server)) to access to protected resources.   

<span id="implementation-hints"></span>
### Implementation hints and notes.

The implementation of V1.1 is work in progress 

The API may be optionally navigated using the links returned for each end point / object e.g.:

    {
        "links": [
            {
                "link": {
                    "rel": "banks",
                    "href": "/banks",
                    "method": "GET",
                    "title": "Returns a list of banks supported on this server"
                }
            }
        ]
    }

See [this discussion about how links may work](https://github.com/OpenBankProject/OBP-API/wiki/How-links-should-work)

<span id="views"></span>
### The views

Views on accounts and transactions filter the underlying data to hide or blur certain fields from certain users. For instance the balance on an account may be hidden from the public or replaced by + or -.

**data:** When a view moderates a set of data, some fields my contain the value "unauthorized" rather than the original value. This indicates that the user is not allowed to see the original data.

There are currently two exceptions to this rule:

1) The "holder" field in the JSon contains a value which is either an alias or the real name - indicated by the "is_alias" field.

2) The "balance" field (in a transaction or account details) may contain the real amount, a plus sign (+), a minus sign (-) or "unauthorized".

**action:** When a user performs an action like trying to post a comment (with POST API call), if he is not allowed, the repose will be an "unauthorized" http code 401.

**Metadata:**  
The comments and tags added to a transaction in a view will appears ONLY on this view. e.g. comments posted to the public view only appear on the public view.

The other account metadata fields like image_URL, more_info etc are unique through all the views. Example, if a user edit the "more_info" field in the "team" view, then the view "authorities" will show the new value (if it is allowed to do it).
