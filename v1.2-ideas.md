Other Account:

Currently when an "other account" is referenced via a transaction it returns:  
JSON:

    {
        "id": "unique identifier",
        "number": "19123",
        "holder": "Bob",
        "national_identifier": "the national identifier of the account e.g. aze1239SQx",
        "IBAN":"the international identifier of the account e.g. AZEDSQDA",
        "bank_name":"the bank name e.g. POSTBANK",
        "swift_bic":"the international identifier of the bank e.g. 12321SDXSAZEAZD1"
    }

It would be good to change this to match the "other account" format that is accessed from an "account" (currently shown in 1.1 additions):

JSON:

    {
        "other_account": {
            "id" : "the other account's id",
            "holder": {
                "name": "DEUTSCHEPOSTAG, SSCACCS",
                "is_alias": "true/false"
            },
            "number": "",
            "kind": "",
            "bank": {
                "IBAN": "",
                "national_identifier": "",
                "name": ""
            },
            "metadata": {
                "more_info": "short text explaining who the other party of the transaction is",
                "URL": "a URL related to the other party e.g. the website of the company",
                "image_URL": "an image URL related to the other party e.g. company logo",
                "open_corporates_URL": "the company corporate URL in the http://opencorporates.com/ web service "
            }
    }
}
